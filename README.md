# Timeless Style CSS Framework

**A solid + satisfying Sass starting point for stable and sane stylesheet architecture.**

Timeless is what I start all my web project with, to save time re-writing code for every site. It has the basics like a CSS reset, clean but minimal styling for elements like forms and buttons, and a rock-solid and tasteful typographic hierarchy and modular scale.

Other neat features include:

- Division of styles into layout-critical in `main.scss`and non-essential styles `defer.scss` (which can be loaded at leisure).
- Simple breakpoint mixins for responsive design
- Easily customizable colour palette + typography â€” you only need to edit one file to get a unique look.
- Fontawesome icons (optional)
- Helpful helpers for basic layout and styling
- Great typography by default
- Timeless is made of small, discreet components: only use what you need.
- Responsive image gallery, pullquotes, and more

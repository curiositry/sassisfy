# Sassisfy

**A solid + satisfying Sass starting point for stable and sane stylesheet architecture.**

Sassisfy is what I start all my web project with, and eliminates writing code thatâ€™s the same for every site. It has the basics like a CSS reset, clean but minimal styling for elements like forms and buttons, and a rock-solid and tasteful typographic hierarchy and modular scale.

Other neat features include:

- Division of styles into layout-critical in main.scss, while things that are non-essential are in defer.scss and can be loaded at leisure.
- Simple breakpoint mixins for responsive design
- Variables for colours and typography so you only have to edit one file to get a unieque look.
- Fontawesome (optional)
- Helpful helpers for basic layout and styling
